## <a name='introduction'>Introduction</a>

The Rest is a core component of a balanced life.
According to Harvard Medical School, additional benefits of rest include increased concentration, memory function and overall mood.

Let's me introduce to you **Sleepy Follow**

## <a name='objectives'>Objectives</a>

The goal of this application is to create a simple application to allow people
to have some rest on available rooms around them.

## <a name='stack'>Stack</a>

The stack is pretty simple:
- Node.js 7.0+
- React Native 0.44+

## <a name='mockup'>Mockup</a>

## <a name='step-01>[.1] Login</a>

First of all, you **must** initialize your project and create a simple login package
with our sexy logo and a **Facebook** button (without any interaction right now)

## <a name='step-02'>02. Map</a>

Using the add-on [`react-native-maps`](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps)
from **Airbnb**, you are going to create the main page of the application.

#### About ui/x design and layout
<br />

This **page** have **4** main parts:
- A search icon button
- A group of 3 buttons to indicate the time (`10min`, `20min` and `30min`)
- A 3 dots slider to specify the range (`100m`, `500m` and `1km`)

When clicking on a **marker**, you must indicate the nap-position details:
- `Name`
- `Address`

When clicking on the search button, you must display an input with an
auto-complete search field like below

When a place is selected, you must display a bottom screen with 3 informations:
- A text field with the `Name` and the `Price` of the nap
- A button for the reservation
- An icon button for a delayed reservation (cf below)
